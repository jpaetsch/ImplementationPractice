## Summary


## Setup & Usage


## Potential Improvements


## Technologies
This project is created with:
* C (standard C99)
* pthreads (POSIX thread libraries)

## Inspiration
Multi-threading and multi-threaded programs are an important concept; trying to practice using
the POSIX threads library for practical applications.

## Sources
Originally a school assignment but heavily modified since:
* IO.c, IO.h, and timer.h files were provided and are mostly unmodified
* Worked with partner Braden Stolte [@b-stolte](https://github.com/b-stolte)
