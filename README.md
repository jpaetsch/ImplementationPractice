## Summary
A code repository for mini-projects, personal examples, and my implementations for a variety of data structures, algorithms,
and other coding concepts.

## Setup & Usage
See individual project folders.

## Potential Improvements
All implementations have my own personal touch; there are undoubtedly numerous improvements that can be made but see individual examples
for their own in-depth improvement ideas.

## Technologies
All these projects cover a wide span of different tools and coding languages.  See individual sub-project folders for what they
specifically use.

## Inspiration
I hear and I forget.\
I see and I remember.\
I do and I understand.\
Trying to get better and learn more each and every day.

## Sources
Online resources are used extensively when I don't understand something, and my school is a starting point
for much of my knowledge and several of these code examples.  Most of the code is from scratch as it is meant for
my own practice and hands-on experience.
