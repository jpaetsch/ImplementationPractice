## Summary
Two different executable versions demonstrating linked list.  Simple linked list is very basic while
linked list is more comprehensive and provides more functionality.

## Setup & Usage
'''make''' - Compiles two different executables; one for each implementation\
'''./linkedlist''' OR '''./linkedlist-simple''' - Execute either version\
In addition, there are '''make clean''' and '''make debug''' targets


## Potential Improvements
The simple linked list is not very functionally useful although it provides a basic implementation of this data structure.\
There are many areas of improvement for the regular linked list including:
* Cleaning up the indexing (feels odd right now)
* Adding of search/delete by value (instead of position) operations
* Better edge case handling, could include a private length variable for the linked list object

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* C++ (standard C++17)

## Inspiration
Linked lists are an essential data structure to know and understand and have many potential use cases.

Looked at various online sources if I got stuck with a particular operation but programmed it from scratch.
